# CS323-Compiler-SPLC

:smile This is the course projects for CS323-Compilers from SUSTech CSE department.

+ SPLC is the abbreviation of SUSTech Programming Language Compiler

+ SPL: A self-defined compiler for programming langauge SPL (C without some basic grammers or syntactic sugar. Eg: array, pointer...)：
 
+ The project goal is to design a compiler for the SPL.

+ Progress:

  + Phase 1: Add lexical analysis and syntactic analysis function to the SPLC
  
  + Phase 2: Add sematic analysis and syntactic analysis function to the SPLC
  
  + Phase 3: Translate the source code to IR (Three Address Code in our project) and optimize result IR sets. (*.ir files)
  
  + Phase 4: Translate the TACs to MIPS32 assembly code. (*.s files)
